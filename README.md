# BadOS
Fun BadUSB scripts for iOS! Tested with BadBT Made for the Flipper Zero!!

ㅤ

More Custom script TOOLs for iOS, instead of those boring basic scripts like opeing a website then inserts a URL. 
ㅤ

But with some of these scripts you can get more keyboard access for iPad and iPhone! 

ㅤ

such as :

ㅤ

The "Caught in 4k" Script

Description : Opens up a sepcific link and screenshots what your looking at :)

ㅤ

The "RLSWIPER" Script

Description : Goes through the device and check out everything (is not perfect)

ㅤ

The "My Last Picture" Script

Description : Crashes the screen with a bunch of pictures (may reboots itself, may depend on the device) USE WISELY!

ㅤ

The "Not MY TABS" Script

Description : DELTES 100+ TABS USE WISELY!

ㅤ

The "Tab Flooder" Script

Description : SPAMS OVER 100+ TABS USE WISELY!

ㅤ

The "Text Me" Script

Description : Opens up Messages and types to whoever was last texted

ㅤㅤ

The "Tab Viewer" Script

Description : goes through your tabs 1-9 and check them out (May need to adjust Delay depending on internet speed)

(REMINDER THESE ARE NOT PERFECT SCRIPTS MAY NEED TO REDO SOME FOR THEM TO WORK)
